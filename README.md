## 🔍 Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness if left untreated. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment, but manual screening by ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subject to variability.

This project implements a hybrid deep learning approach that:

1. **Accurately classifies** retinal images into 5 severity levels of DR
2. **Quantifies uncertainty** in predictions using Bayesian methods
3. **Explains decisions** through gradient-based visualization techniques
4. **Addresses class imbalance** through focal loss and weighting strategies

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📊 **Preprocessing Pipeline** | Ben Graham's technique with green channel extraction, CLAHE, and denoising |
| 🧠 **Hybrid Architecture** | EfficientNetB0 + Swin Transformer for improved feature representation |
| 🔍 **Bayesian Uncertainty** | Monte Carlo Dropout for confidence estimation and uncertainty quantification |
| 👁️ **Explainable AI** | Grad-CAM visualizations showing which retinal regions influence decisions |
| ⚖️ **Class Imbalance Handling** | Focal Loss and class weighting techniques to handle unbalanced datasets |

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

![Architecture](assets/hybrid_model_architecture.png)

Our hybrid architecture combines:
- **EfficientNetB0**: Pre-trained CNN for efficient feature extraction
- **Swin Transformer**: Attention-based refinement of features with hierarchical window partitioning
- **Monte Carlo Dropout**: Bayesian approximation for uncertainty estimation
- **Grad-CAM**: Class activation mapping for model explainability

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on the [APTOS 2019 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) dataset, which contains retinal fundus photographs labeled with DR severity levels:

| Class | Severity Level | Description | Visual Signs |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| 0 | No DR | No signs of diabetic retinopathy | Normal retina |
| 1 | Mild | Microaneurysms only | Small red dots |
| 2 | Moderate | More than microaneurysms but less than severe | Red lesions, hard exudates |
| 3 | Severe | Extensive hemorrhages and venous beading | Cotton wool spots, venous beading |
| 4 | Proliferative | Abnormal blood vessel growth and potential retinal detachment | Neovascularization, preretinal hemorrhage |

## 📈 Results

> **Note:** The table below matches the placeholder/sample values hardcoded as fallback data in `Visualization_Scripts/create_publication_tables.py` (used when no real `model_comparison.csv` is present) rather than a verified `classification_report` run on held-out test data. Treat these numbers as illustrative until they are regenerated from an actual evaluation run.
